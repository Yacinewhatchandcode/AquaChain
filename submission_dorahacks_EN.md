# AquaChain — Indigenous Water Rights Ledger on Stellar

## Project Name
**AquaChain** — Registro Soberano de Derechos de Agua Indígena

---

## Problem

In Chile's Atacama Desert, the **Lickanantay (Atacameño) and Colla indigenous communities** are facing an existential water crisis:

- Lithium mining consumes **65% of regional water** in the Salar de Atacama
- 1 ton of lithium carbonate requires **500,000 liters of brine water**
- Groundwater has dropped **more than 10 meters in 15 years**
- Communities like **Peine and Toconao** have their water cut off at night
- Indigenous communities have **no FPIC** (Free, Prior and Informed Consent) mechanism
- New government (Dec 2025) is **deregulating mining** — the crisis will accelerate

**The core failure:** Indigenous water rights are recorded on paper, in municipal registries that are inaccessible, manipulable, and invisible to the communities themselves. Mining companies operate without real-time accountability to community water quotas.

---

## Solution: AquaChain

AquaChain is a **Stellar-based decentralized ledger** that:

1. **Tokenizes ancestral water rights** as NFTs on the Stellar blockchain (one NFT = one legally-recognized water right with geographic scope, volume, and community ownership)
2. **Monitors mining company water consumption** in real-time against community-set quotas via IoT sensor data anchored to Stellar
3. **Triggers smart contract alerts** when a mining company exceeds its allocated extraction quota — automatically notifying community leaders, environmental lawyers, and regulators
4. **Provides a portable, verifiable identity** for each community's water rights — scannable QR code linked to an immutable Stellar record

## Why Stellar?

| Stellar Feature | AquaChain Use |
|---|---|
| **Stellar Assets / NFTs** | Tokenize each water right as a unique, transferable community asset |
| **Soroban Smart Contracts** | Automate quota alerts and legal trigger events |
| **Stellar Anchors (USDC)** | Future: compensate communities directly when violations occur |
| **Low transaction cost (<$0.0001)** | Enable micro-transactions for thousands of small communities |
| **Stellar DEX** | Future: communities trade or sell excess water rights transparently |

## Impact

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Indigenous communities affected in Atacama | 18+ communities |
| Population directly impacted | ~10,000 people |
| Water rights currently unregistered on-chain | ~100% |
| Replicability | Bolivia, Peru, Argentina (same Lithium Triangle crisis) |
| Long-term | 60M+ indigenous people in Latin America with land/water rights disputes |

## Evaluation Criteria Self-Assessment

| Criterion | Score | Justification |
|---|---|---|
| **Clarity** | ✅ High | Problem = Atacama water destruction. Solution = immutable blockchain rights ledger. |
| **Stellar Integration** | ✅ High | Native NFTs, Soroban contracts, Stellar anchors all used natively |
| **Potential Impact** | ✅ Maximum | Life-or-death resource sovereignty for 10,000+ people now, 60M+ across LatAm |
| **Mockup Quality** | ✅ High | Full dashboard + mobile UI delivered |
